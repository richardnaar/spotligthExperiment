Replication of the task in:

Müller, M. M., Malinowski, P., Gruber, T., & Hillyard, S. A. (2003). Sustained division of the attentional spotlight. Nature, 424(6946), 309-312. 


NB! Will not run out-of-the-box. This version uses monitor settings saved under the name of "spotlight" - you can change that, but this just to remind you
that monitor settings should be changed before running the experiment in a new location. You can change the monitor name if you go
to Edit experiment settings (ratchet icon in the menu) > Screen

Make sure to ...
- ... set the monitor refresh rate to either 60 or 120 (make also appropriate selection prior to the experiment in the infobox)
- ... configure the monitor settings in the PsychoPy accordingly (including size, distance, and resolution of screen). Click on the monitor icon to change the
screen settings.

You can check if the objects presented on screen correspond to the degrees of visual angles aimed for by setting the distnace to be
57 cm. In that case the degrees and cm should match and you can measure them on the screen (e.g. the 4 boxes presented should be 2.5 x 3.2 cm).
