Replication of the task in:

Müller, M. M., Malinowski, P., Gruber, T., & Hillyard, S. A. (2003). Sustained division of the attentional spotlight. Nature, 424(6946), 309-312. 


NB! Will not run out-of-the-box. This version uses monitor settings saved under the name of "spotlight". 

You can change that by going: Edit experiment settings (ratchet icon on meny bar) > Screen

Make sure to ...
- ... set the resolution of the monitor to 800 x 600 pixels
- ... set the monitor refresh rate to either 60 or 120 (make also appropriate selection prior the experiment in the infobox)
- ... configure the monitor settings in the PsychoPy accordingly (including size of the screen and distance from the screen)

You can change the monitor settings in Monitor settings and Clibrations.
