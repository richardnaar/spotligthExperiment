Replication of the task in:

Müller, M. M., Malinowski, P., Gruber, T., & Hillyard, S. A. (2003). Sustained division of the attentional spotlight. Nature, 424(6946), 309-312. 


NB! This version will not run out-of-the-box. T It uses monitor settings saved under the name 'spotlight'. You can change this, but remember to adjust the monitor settings before running the experiment at a new location. 

To change the monitor name, go to 'Edit experiment settings' (select the ratchet icon in the menu), then choose 'Screen'.

Make sure to ...
- ... set the monitor refresh rate to either 60 or 120 Hz and make the appropriate selection in the infobox prior to the experiment.
- ... configure the monitor settings in PsychoPy to match the required specifications, including screen size, viewing distance, and resolution. Click on the monitor icon to adjust these settings.

To ensure that on-screen objects correspond to the intended degrees of visual angle, set the viewing distance to 57 cm. At this distance, degrees and centimeters should match, allowing you to measure objects directly on the screen (e.g., the box should measure 2.5 x 3.2 cm)."
